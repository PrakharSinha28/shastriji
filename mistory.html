<h2>According to official records Shastriji's death was natural, by heart attack, but there arethings which seem suspecious:</h2>
<h2>The suspecious events include:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Official accounts say that when Shastri ji felt some discomfort, he left his suite and went to his assistan's room but his room itself has 3 phones, where lifting one phone would call the security then why he had to go there himself and never use the phones.</li>
    <li>Russian Intelligence offered to conduct a post mortem, but the offer was rejected by the Indian government</li>
    <li>His body has blue and black patches which were covered by sandalwood paste as if to cover it and hide it.</li>
    <li>No family member was allowed to see the body</li>
    <li>There were blood spots at back of his neck and stomach and his cap was filled with blood which is preserved till date </li>
    <li>A year after hus death, a tabloid named Blitz published his last letter, which was a fake letter and was never written by Shastri ji, writting a fake letter on behalf of a PM is only possible if the person already knew that the person won't be alive to check it</li>
    <li>The cook of Shastri ji in Tashkent disappeared after Shastriji's death</li>
